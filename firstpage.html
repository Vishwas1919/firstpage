	<p style="color:white;background: blue;">
		ascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.

With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!</p>

<h2 style="color:white;background: black;">NOTE-</h2>
<p style="color:white;background:blue;">Tip: The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else)!</p>

<h2 style="color:red;background:yellow">Using CSS?</h2>
<p style="color:white;background:blue;">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</p>
<li> <b>Inline -</b>by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.</li>
<li><b>Internal-</b>by using a style element in the head section</li>
<li><b>External-</b>by using a link element to link to an external CSS file</li>
<p>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</p>
<h2 style="color: red;background: yellow;">Inline CSS?</h2>
<p1 style="color: black;background: blue;">An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.</p1><br>
<p2 style="color: black;background: blue;">An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.</p2>
